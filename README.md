## TO GO - An open source place reminder

**This project is a 3 days coding challenge, described bellow:**

Task:​ Develop an Android App. The app is a simple reminder app with places. Example : You want to visit the “National Parliament House on 20th Oct 2019 at 15:00” and “Square Hospital at 18:30”. Your app will remind you about your visit one day (24 hours) before and also on the exact time regardless of internet connectivity. 
 
The app should have the following features: 
 
1. User should be able to create new reminders along with place name. 
2. The app should be able to search for places from ​Google’s places autocomplete API. 
3. The app should also be able to retrieve the place name and details from ​pick from map (like google maps).  
4. User should be able to ​set a date and time​ that is in the future . The user will also be able to add optional comments to the reminder saved. 
5. The app should also be able to remind the user with a ​notification​ in the notification bar. 
6. A visual representation of the map is mandatory and the places the user saved must be distinguishable in the map. 
 
7. User should see all reminders in Map using Markers or in a List. 
8. The app should be able to show the places and times the user saved in ​offline​ mode. 
 
 
Note​ ​:​ The user can save multiple places, have multiple reminders. UI/UX should follow modern conventions. The UI should be user friendly and simple but must accommodate all the functionalities listed above. 

### How to use

In the main screen there are 2 tab -
1. Home
2. Dashboard

#### Home 
Displays a map and all scheduled locations. On taping on a Place of Interest, a temporary marker and a SnackBar with Schedule button will be visible. Tapping on the schedule button will allow you to set reminder for that location at a specific given time. You can also search a location and add schedule.

#### Dashboard
Displays a list of saved schedules.
